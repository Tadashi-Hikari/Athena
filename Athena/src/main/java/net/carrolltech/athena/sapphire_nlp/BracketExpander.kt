/**
 * This is fairly directly copied from Mycrofts Padatatious parser. Why reinvent the wheel?
 * Padatious skills: {bracket} indicates an entity, {bracket} could be an existing entity, or a wildcard.
 * (A | B) indicates OR. It could be recursive, and it can have a blank space " " in the B position
 * which indicates that it can be their or not. # is a number wildcard matcher. There is some code
 * to ignore brackets without the pipe/bar in the sentence. As far as I can tell, this is so things like
 * phone numbers (###) ###-#### can be properly entered
 *
 * So.... This actually needs to be moved in to a Mycroft Module instead of here
